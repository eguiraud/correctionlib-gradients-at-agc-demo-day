# correctionlib-gradients @ AGC Demo Day 1/12/2023

Material supporting the presentation.

One way to get a Python environment in which the notebook runs correctly is via [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/):

```shell
# from the repo's root dir
hatch run jupyter lab
```

`correctionlib-gradients` is basically the only direct dependency.
